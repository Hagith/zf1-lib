 * GENERAL SETTINGS
 *
 * ZEND_INCLUDE_PATH should be absolute path to Zend Framework if it's not
 * placed in ./library/Zend directory.
 *
 * OB_ENABLED should be enabled for some tests to check if all functionality
 * works as expected. Such tests include those for Zend\Soap and Zend\Session,
 * which require that headers not be sent in order to work.
